# Liquent SDK E2E Test Script Documentation

This document describes how to use the End-to-End (E2E) test script [scripts/e2e_test.sh](file:///home/ling/liquentlabs/liquent/scripts/e2e_test.sh). This script executes the entire testing pipeline (build, deploy, node start, benchmark) inside a Docker container, ensuring a distinct and reproducible environment.

## Usage

### Command

Run the script from the root of the repository, providing the target git branch as an argument:

```bash
bash scripts/e2e_test.sh <branch_name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Test the 'main' branch
bash scripts/e2e_test.sh main

# Test a feature branch
bash scripts/e2e_test.sh fix/consensus-issue
```

### Prerequisites
- **Docker**: Must be installed and running. `rust` is NOT required on the host machine as the build happens inside the container.
- **Network**: The script binds port `9001` on the host. Ensure it is available.

## Parameters

The script accepts the following parameters via environment variables (optional) and command-line arguments:

| Argument / Variable | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `$1` (Argument) | **Required**. The git branch name to checkout and test (e.g., `main`). |
| `TEST_GENESIS` | The genesis JSON content (defined inside the wrapper script). |
| `GIT_REF` | Passed automatically from `$1`. |
| `CLONE_URL` | The repository URL to clone inside Docker. |
| `DURATION` | Benchmark duration in seconds (Default: 300). |
| `BENCH_CONFIG_PATH` | Path to the benchmark configuration file (Default: `./scripts/bench_config.toml`). |

### Benchmark Configuration

The benchmark configuration is passed to the Docker container via file mounting. You can customize the benchmark by:

1. **Using the default config**: The script uses `scripts/bench_config.toml` by default.
2. **Specifying a custom config**: Set the `BENCH_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

**Example with custom config:**
```bash
BENCH_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/my_bench_config.toml bash scripts/e2e_test.sh main
```

## Logs & Monitoring

The test runs inside a Docker container (`rust:1.88.0-bookworm`).

### Vital Logs
- **Benchmark Logs**: Located at `/liquent_bench/log.*.log` inside the container.
- **Node Logs**: The node runs in the background. logs are typically in `/tmp/node1/` inside the container.

### How to Inspect Logs

Since the process runs inside Docker, you have two main ways to view logs:

#### 1. Real-time Output (Standard)
The script runs `docker run` in interactive mode (`-i`), so the standard output of the test steps (build progress, benchmark summary) will be streamed directly to your terminal.

#### 2. attaching to the Container (Deep Dive)
To inspect files (like detailed debug logs) or check the node status *while the test is running*:

1.  **Find the Container ID**:
    Open a new terminal and run:
    ```bash
    docker ps
    # Look for the container using image 'rust:1.88.0-bookworm'
    ```

2.  **Enter the Container**:
    Use `docker exec` to open a shell inside the running container:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it <container_id> bash
    ```

3.  **View Logs**:
    Once inside:
    ```bash
    # View Benchmark logs. The log will report the TPS of node.
    tail -f /liquent_bench/log.*.log

    # View Node logs/status
    # (Assuming logs are redirected or managed by start.sh in /tmp/node1)
    ls -l /tmp/node1/
    ```

#### 3. Attaching to Main Process
If you ran the script in the background or want to re-attach to the main script output:
```bash
docker attach <container_id>
```
*Note: This connects you to the main execution process. Pressing `Ctrl+C` here might terminate the test.*

### Metrics Monitoring

The script exposes metrics on port `9001` of the host machine (`-p 9001:9001`), allowing you to monitor Liquent node performance in real-time using a metrics system.

#### Quick Check
You can quickly verify metrics are available by running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:9001/metrics
```

#### Prometheus & Grafana Setup
For detailed performance analysis, you can set up a Prometheus & Grafana monitoring stack to visualize metrics such as TPS, latency, block production rate, and more.

Refer to the [Liquent Reth Monitoring Guide](https://github.com/liquentlabs/liquent-reth/blob/main/docs/vocs/docs/pages/run/monitoring.mdx) for instructions on:
- Configuring Prometheus to scrape metrics from `localhost:9001`
- Setting up Grafana dashboards for Liquent performance visualization. Using [lreth-performance.json](https://github.com/liquentlabs/liquent-reth/blob/main/etc/grafana/dashboards/lreth-performance.json) as the dashboards json imports.

## Script Logic Overview

1.  **Genesis Injection**: Pipes `TEST_GENESIS` (defined in the host script) into the Docker container.
2.  **Config Mounting**: Mounts the benchmark config file (`bench_config.toml`) into the container at `/liquent_bench/bench_config.toml`.
3.  **Environment Setup**: Installs dependencies (`clang`, `llvm`, `node`, `python3`) inside Docker.
4.  **Clone & Configure**: Clones the SDK branch, writes genesis, and updates `reth_config.json` using `jq`.
5.  **Build & Deploy**: builds `liquent_node` and deploys it to `/tmp/node1`.
6.  **Benchmark**: Downloads `liquent_bench` and runs the benchmark using the mounted config file.
7.  **Verification**: Analyzes the benchmark logs using a Python script to verify success.
