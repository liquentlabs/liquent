"""
Bridge E2E Test — Pre-Load & Verify

Tests the full bridge flow with pre-loaded transactions:
    1. Pre-load: N bridge txns sent on Anvil (liquent_node stopped)
    2. Start: liquent_node starts, relayer fetches all events in batch
    3. Verify: poll for all N NativeMinted events, check balance + nonces

This avoids the "starvation" problem where liquent_node processes faster
than Anvil can produce new bridge events.
