Test: Batch block execution via BATCH_COMMIT_SIZE environment variable.

Scenario:
    1. Start node normally, confirm it produces blocks.
    2. Stop the node.
    3. Set BATCH_COMMIT_SIZE=10 in the environment.
    4. Restart the node → consensus will batch-accumulate blocks
       and only send to execution when blocks_to_commit > 10.
    5. Wait for the chain to resume producing blocks, confirming
       the batch execution path works end-to-end.
