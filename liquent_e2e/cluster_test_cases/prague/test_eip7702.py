"""EIP-7702 (SetCode tx, type 0x04) e2e acceptance.

Verifies post-Prague behavior observable via contract execution:
  P-B1  delegated stateless call returns the target contract's value
  P-B2  delegated stateful call uses the authority's storage, not the target's
  P-B3  revocation (target = 0x0) reverts the authority to plain-EOA behavior
  P-B4  pipe-exec filter discards low-intrinsic-gas SetCode tx
  P-B5  filter admits sufficiently-gassed SetCode tx
  P-B6  self-sponsored self-delegation (tx.from == authority) does not halt the chain
  P-B7  type-4 tx with empty authorizationList is filtered; chain stays alive
  P-B8  delegated EOA can still send a plain type-2 tx (EIP-3607 designator carve-out)

    Inner CALL targets `sender` by default (EOA self-call, no-op) so the tx

    would invoke the freshly-installed delegate's fallback — Delegate.sol /
    Counter.sol don't define one, and the revert would mask designator
    installation behind a tx-level failure.

    When `sender == authority` (self-sponsored self-delegation), two things
    differ:
      - the auth tuple's nonce must be `sender_nonce + 1` because the tx
        bumps the sender's nonce before the authorization list is processed;
      - the default `to = sender.address` self-call would invoke the
        freshly-installed delegate code on the sender itself, hitting the
        missing fallback. Callers must pass `to_override` to a no-code
        address (any fresh EOA works) to keep the inner call as a no-op.
